# bunyedit: worldedit for bunys


hi! this is a minecraft mod for better than adventure. it's my own take on a
worldedit-like :)

it works as a mod and as a "server plugin": you have to install the mod on the client to
use it in singleplayer, but only the server needs it in multiplayer.

here's a video showing some features:

someone is already doing a worldedit-like (it's called
[bta-worldedit](https://github.com/FatherCheese/bta-worldedit)) but i wanted to try doing
my own take on it. thank you to the author of that for inspiration!

this is not a fork of either worldedit or bta-worldedit, but i have read bits of their
code.

## summary of features

- Cursor tool that can select blocks from long distances using left and right click!
- Command-based selection manipulation! (relative moving, growing, shrinking)
- Masking your selection to create different shapes!
- Setting and replacing blocks in the selected region!
- Union filters, inverted filters, metadata-fuzzy filters!
- Randomized block patterns!
- Moving, flipping, and stacking the selected region!
- Recursively bucket-filling adjacent blocks matching a filter!
- Copy and paste, undo and redo!
- Plays nice with tile entities! (e.g. chests will copy with their inventories intact)
